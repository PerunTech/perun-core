# Contributing to Perun Core

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Perun Core, the front-end module of the [Svarog Business Platform](https://github.com/PerunTech/svarog).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.12.0 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v8 or higher
- Java JDK (for the OSGi bundle build via Maven)

## Getting Started

## Development Workflow

### Branching

- Base your branch off `dev`.
- Use descriptive branch names, e.g. `feature/session-token-header` or `fix/grid-reload`.

### Making Changes

- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per pull request.
- Run the linter before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
- Build the bundle to verify it compiles cleanly:
  ```bash
  npm run build-dev
  ```
