 * for them synchronously while rendering the preview and has nowhere to await. Cleared and re-read
 * whenever the document or its module changes, so a figure from the guide just closed can never
 * resolve inside the next one.
 *
 * @param {object}   editing       the document open in the editor, or null
 * @param {string}   editingModule the module its route belongs to, which owns its figures
 * @param {Function} anchorFor     module id to plugin row
 * @param {object}   cache         a blob cache from createBlobCache
 * @returns {{resolveImage: Function, uploadImage: Function}} the two callbacks the editor takes
