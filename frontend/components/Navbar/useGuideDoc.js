 * Only the figures the document actually references are fetched, and only once the reader has
 * opened that document, so an illustrated manual costs nothing until it is read.
 *
 * @param {object} active the guide record on screen, or null for the list
 * @param {object} cache  a blob cache from createBlobCache
 * @returns {{doc: object, resolveImage: Function}}
 *   `doc.loading` matters to every caller: `active` flips a render before the fetch for it starts,
 *   so a surface reading `doc` without it would draw the new guide's chrome over the old one's body.
