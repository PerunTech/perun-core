 * Opens one guide in its own browser window.
 *
 * The window is populated directly rather than pointed at a URL, so it costs nothing: no route, no
 * second boot of the application, no repeated fetch. The nodes come from the same renderer the
 * drawer uses, imported into the new document, so the popup can never drift from the panel.
 *
 * Figures keep working because a window opened on about:blank is same origin, and blob URLs minted
 * by the opener resolve in it. The corollary is that they die with the opening document: a full
 * reload of the application leaves an already-open guide window with broken figures. Reopening it
 * from the drawer fixes that, which is the trade for not booting the app twice.

// from the backend origin and reading cssRules across origins throws.
//
// Nothing in either matches the popup's markup except the md-preview rules, which is the point.
