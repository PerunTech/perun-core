/**
 * The two forms a guide leaves the application in.
 *
 * A PDF is the form it is read and kept in: one file, figures included, that opens anywhere and
 * prints as it looks. An archive of the Markdown with its figures beside it is the form it is
 * edited and moved in, and is what an author uploads into another deployment.
 *
 * There is deliberately no single .md download. Markdown cannot carry an image, so such a file
 * either points at figures that are not next to it or inlines them as data: URIs, which a good half
 * of the Markdown viewers in use refuse to draw. Splitting the two jobs is what makes both work.
