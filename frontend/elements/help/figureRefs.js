/**
 * The figure references a Markdown document carries.
 *
 * Deliberately a scan rather than a parse: the editor runs this alongside typing, where a full
 * parse-and-sanitize pass would repeat the render cost for no extra information. Raw <img> tags are
 * rendered correctly by the preview but are not reported here, which is fine for every caller: the
 * editor prefetches from it, and the exporters use it to decide which files to carry along.
 *
 * Kept in one place because the reader, the editor, the archive and the PDF all have to agree on
 * what counts as a figure. A reference form got right in three of them and wrong in the fourth is a
 * figure that silently goes missing from one surface.
